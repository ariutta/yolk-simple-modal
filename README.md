# yolk-simple-modal

[Yolk](https://github.com/garbles/yolk) wrapper for [wunderlink/simple-modal](https://github.com/wunderlink/simple-modal).

This module runs a post-install script to compile the coffeescript, Jade and CSS from simple-modal into a single vanilla JS file. This JS file is then wrapped to work with Yolk as a `CustomComponent`.
